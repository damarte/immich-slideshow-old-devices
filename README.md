# Immich Slideshow for old Devices

A simple PHP-based slideshow application for Immich album photos, designed to work on older devices and browsers (iOS 9, old Android, ECMAScript 2009...). It displays photos from a specified Immich album in a full-screen slideshow format.

One day I decided to dust off two old iPads I had in a drawer (an iPad 2 and an iPad mini) to use them as digital photo frames, so my parents could see their granddaughter's photos from an album of my Immich instance.

I searched for projects already created for this purpose and found the great [Immich Kiosk](https://github.com/damongolding/immich-kiosk), it's a good project but it doesn't work on such old devices, so I decided to create a simple alternative but that works on older browsers and devices.
